Q. Why is parallelizing over threads better than parallelizing over processes?
A. Threads are light weight which means: Time taken to create a thread is less than time taken to create a process. Communication between threads doesn't require IPC (interprocess communication) - which means most likely no system calls. Efficient context switching because context of a thread is smaller than the context of a process, therefore less data need to be saved.


Other information about threads:
1. Each thread has its own stack and its own register.
